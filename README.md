# bottomup

This repo contains some of the code for engine for [Mr Figs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3122220/Mr_Figs).

Certain things aren't shared because then anything based on the engine will just feel like Mr Figs, but I'm opening up everything that's "Figs-agnostic" in the hopes that others (particularly pygamers) find it useful

Additions TBC...

## Why bottomup?

Because Mr Figs is top down and this is the opposite of that.
Plus, it's an "engine" (used very loosely) built from the ground up i.e. bottom up
